**2**

## 2. Experiment Name:  
Best Coding Practices

## 3. Objectives:  
- To understand and implement best practices in coding.
- To learn techniques that improve readability, reduce errors.

## 4. Source Code and Description:  

### **Source Code** (Example in C++):
```c++
#include <iostream>

int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;
    
    std::cout << "Enter first number: ";
    std::cin >> num1;

    std::cout << "Enter second number: ";
    std::cin >> num2;

    sum = calculateSum(num1, num2);

    std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}

```
### **Description**:  
This example highlighted several key coding practices:

1. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Variables like `num1`, `num2`, and `sum` are given clear, descriptive names that make their purpose easily identifiable.
2. **Reusable Functions**: The `calculateSum` function encapsulates the logic for adding two numbers, enhancing modularity and reusability.
3. **Comments**: Clear comments explain each section of the code, helping others (or yourself later) to quickly grasp the logic.
4. **Input Handling**: The program prompts the user to input two numbers, which are then processed.
5. **Efficient Structure**: The sum calculation is isolated in a function, keeping the `main` function clean and focused on the overall flow.
6. **Consistent Formatting**: The code is formatted with proper indentation, promoting readability and maintainability.

## 5. Discussion:  
This focused on writing efficient and maintainable code, which is a key component of best coding practices:

1. **Readable Code**: A key objective of good coding practices is to write code that is easy to read and comprehend. Using descriptive variable and function names, along with proper indentation, significantly enhances readability.

2. **Modularity**: Encapsulating the sum calculation in a separate function makes the code more modular, simplifying testing and future modifications.

3. **Comments and Documentation**: Comments help explain the purpose of different code sections, aiding in understanding when revisiting the code later or collaborating with others.

4. **Efficiency**: Writing functions for specific tasks enhances efficiency, allowing the reuse of logic throughout the program without rewriting it.

5. **Maintainability**: Adhering to best practices makes the code easier to maintain. For example, if the sum logic changes, updating the `calculateSum` function is sufficient, without needing to modify the `main` function.
By adhering to these best practices, the code becomes less prone to errors, easier to debug, and more scalable in the long term. This approach also fosters better collaboration when multiple developers are involved in the project.


## 1. Experiment No:
**3**

## 2. Experiment Name:
Exploring essential Git Commands

## 3. Objectives:
- To understand frequently used Git commands.
- To learn how to use Git for code management and effective collaboration.
- To practice using Git for handling repositories and tracking project changes.

## 4. Theory:
Git is a popular distributed version control system that enables developers to track code changes, work on different branches and merge updates seamlessly. It facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple contributors to work on the same project without conflicts. This experiment focuses on fundamental Git commands for creating, managing and updating repositories as well as effectively handling version control tasks.
### Common Git Commands:
1. `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
2. `git clone`: Copies an existing repository to a local machine.
3. `git status`: Shows the current state of the repository and any uncommitted changes.
4. `git add`: Moves changes to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.
5. `git commit`: Saves the staged changes as a snapshot in the repository.
6. `git log`: Displays the history of commits in the repository.
7. `git push`: Uploads changes from a local repository to a remote one.
8. `git pull`: Fetches and integrates updates from a remote repository into the local one.
9. `git branch`: Manages branches in a repository, creating or deleting them.
10. `git merge`: Merges changes from one branch into another.

## 5. Procedure:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   - Run `git init` to set up a new Git repository in your current directory.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Clone an existing repository**:
   - Use `git clone` to copy an existing repository from a remote server to your local machine.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
     ```

3. **Check the repository status**:
   - Run `git status` to check the current status of the repository, including any unstaged changes.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

4. **Add changes to the staging area**:
   - Use `git add` to stage changes, making them ready for the next commit.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git add Labreport_1.txt
     git add .
     ```

5. **Commit the changes**:
   - Run `git commit` to save the staged changes with a descriptive commit message.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

6. **View the commit history**:
   - Use `git log` to display the history of commits made in the repository.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

7. **Push changes to a remote repository**:
   - Use `git push` to send local commits to a remote repository, like GitHub.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

8. **Pull updates from a remote repository**:
   - Run `git pull` to fetch updates from a remote repository and merge them into your local branch.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

9. **Create and switch branches**:
   - Use `git branch` to create a new branch and switch to it.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git branch feature-branch
     git checkout feature-branch
     ```

10. **Merge branches**:
    - Run `git merge` to merge changes from one branch into another.
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge feature-branch
      ```

## 6. Source Code and Output:

### Commands:
```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check repository status
git status

# Stage changes for commit
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main

# Pull updates from a remote repository
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Merge changes from a branch
git merge feature-branch
```

### Output:
Executing these commands will help you set up and manage a Git repository, monitor changes and collaborate effectively with other developers.
## 7. Discussion:
This experiment offered hands-on experience with essential Git commands for version control in software development.

1. **Repository Initialization**: The `git init` command is used to create a new repository, while `git clone` copies an existing one, enabling developers to manage and work on projects both locally and remotely.

2. **Change Tracking and Staging**: The `git status` command helps check the current file states, and `git add` stages modifications, preparing them to be saved in the repository.

3. **Committing and Pushing**: `git commit` records the current state of the project along with a descriptive message about the changes. The `git push` command uploads the updates to a remote repository, facilitating collaboration.

4. **Branching and Merging**: The `git branch` command allows developers to create and switch between branches, letting them work on features or fixes independently. `git merge` is used to integrate these development branches back together.
